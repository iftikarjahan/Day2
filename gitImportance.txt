->Git is a type of VCS(Version Control System) that tracks changes in anty files

Need OF VCS
->Revert selected files to previous state
->compare changes over time
->Prevents data loss
->Track diffrent changes done by diffrent people in diffrent organisations

Types of VCS---
1. CVCS->Centralised Version Control System
In CVCS, we have a centralised datsbase and this centralised datsbase is also called master or remote server.Any changes done
has to be pushed to this centralised datsbase.
Its benefit is that its easy to understand ans its drawback is that we cannot access data if connectivity is lost.


2. DVCS->Distributed Version Control System
In DVCS, every computer has a local repository associted with it. This lr(local repository) acts as an intermediary
between the master and the loscal computers.
One of the major advantage of DVCS is that if connectivity is lost, we still dont face the problem as all the data is present
in the lr(local repository).


GIT->Its a DVCS
There are three stages of a git file->
1.Modidied->This state is in the working directory
2.Staged->After modifing the files, we put them in the staging area so that we can commit them in the lr
3.Commited->The files present in the staged area is then commited to put it in the local repository
